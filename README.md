My name is Ziheng Zhang.
I am a senior undergraduate in computer science & mathematics at The Ohio State University. I am very fortunately being advised by Prof. [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao). and working closely with Dr. [Jianyang Gu](https://vimar-gu.github.io).
My areas of interest include Explainable and Interpretable AI, Multimodal Learning and Reasoning.
